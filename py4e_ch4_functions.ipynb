    "# Ch 4: Python Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 4 of Py4E goes into functions, starting by showing several functions we've already seen, like the `type` function to get a variable's type, the type conversion functions (`float(input)`), etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.2 Built-in functions\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the design goals of Python was to keep the main language, the built-in functions, relatively limited. You can do a fair bit with the built-in functions, but you will almost always need to import additional functions. The idea here is that different people need different functions, so rather than make a bloated language that has everything, allow people to import what they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.4 Math functions (p. 45)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we `import math` because we want some functions that are not in the built-in functions of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.5 Random numbers (p.46)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an interesting bit on `pseudorandom` numbers--computers cannot make truely random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember the dot notation: once imported, the functions that are part of a module can be called with the `module.function` format as in `random.random` in this case since both the module and function are called \"random\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the next cell several times and notice that you get different numbers each time."

    "* Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",
